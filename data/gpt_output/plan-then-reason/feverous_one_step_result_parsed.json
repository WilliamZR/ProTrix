Write SQL and execute SQL\nSQL 1:\n```sql\nSELECT author FROM Table WHERE year = 2003\n```\n\nExecuted result 1:\n| row_id | year | book | author | image |\n| 11 | 2003 | bertrand russell | v. babusenan | nan |\n\nSQL 2:\n```sql\nSELECT author FROM Table WHERE year = 2004\n```\n\nExecuted result 2:\n| row_id | year | book | author | image |\n| 12 | 2004 | orachante ormmakkuripukal | t. v. eachara warrier | nan |\n\n3. Step-by-step Reasoning\n- The claim states that Bertrand Russell by V. Babusenan won the 2003 Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award for Biography and Autobiography, and Achan by T. V. Eachara Warrier won the same award the following year.\n- The SQL queries show that Bertrand Russell by V. Babusenan won the award in 2003, and Achan by T. V. Eachara Warrier won the award in 2004.\n- The evidence from the table refutes the claim that Bertrand Russell by V. Babusenan won the award in 2003 and Achan by T. V. Eachara Warrier won the award the following year. Therefore, the answer is <REFUTES>.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<REFUTES>",

The claim mentions other sports personalities like Alistair Brownlee, Nick Skelton, Mo Farah, Sophie Christiansen, and Kate Richardson-Walsh not garnering any votes. We need to verify this part as well.\n- We will write SQL queries to check both parts of the claim.\n\n2. Write SQL and execute SQL\nSQL 1:\n```sql\nSELECT nominee, votes_percentage\nFROM Table\nWHERE nominee = 'andy murray' AND votes_percentage = '33.1%'\n```\n\nExecuted result:\n| nominee     | votes_percentage |\n|-------------|------------------|\n| andy murray | 33.1%            |\n\nSQL 2:\n```sql\nSELECT nominee, votes_percentage\nFROM Table\nWHERE nominee IN ('alistair brownlee', 'nick skelton', 'mo farah', 'sophie christiansen', 'kate richardson-walsh')\nAND votes_percentage = '0%'\n```\n\nExecuted result:\n| nominee              | votes_percentage |\n|----------------------|------------------|\n| sophie christiansen  | 0%              |\n| kate richardson-walsh | 0%              |\n\n3. Step-by-step Reasoning\n- The first SQL query result confirms that Andy Murray won the 2016 BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award with 33.1% of the votes, supporting the claim.\n- The second SQL query result shows that Sophie Christiansen and Kate Richardson-Walsh did not garner any votes, which also supports the claim.\n- Therefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the context. The answer is <SUPPORTS>.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<SUPPORTS>",

Nine teams competed in the 2015\u201316 Hong Kong Premier League.\n  2. The Eastern team had the most number of attendance.\n- We can write a SQL query to count the number of teams in the 2015\u201316 Hong Kong Premier League and to find the attendance of each team to determine which team had the most attendance.\n\n2. Write SQL and execute SQL\nSQL 1:\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM Table WHERE season = '2015\u201316';\n```\n\nExecuted result:\n| COUNT(*) |\n|----------|\n| 1        |\n\nSQL 2:\n```sql\nSELECT season, MAX(total_attendance) FROM Table WHERE season = '2015\u201316';\n```\n\nExecuted result:\n| season   | MAX(total_attendance) |\n|----------|-----------------------|\n| eastern  | 4130                  |\n\n3. Step-by-step Reasoning\n- The first SQL query result shows that there is only one row for the season '2015\u201316', indicating that there was only one team in the 2015\u201316 Hong Kong Premier League, not nine teams as claimed.\n- The second SQL query result shows that the Eastern team had the highest attendance of 4,130, supporting the claim that the Eastern team had the most number of attendance.\n- Since the claim about the number of teams competing in the league is refuted by the table, and the claim about the Eastern team having the most attendance is supported, the final answer is <REFUTES>.",

The scheduled caste population in Khuangleng is 0.\n- The claim also states that more than 80 percent of the population is literate. From the table, the total population of Khuangleng is 1686, and the number of literates is 1353.
