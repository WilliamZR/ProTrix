Write SQL and execute SQL\nSince the table does not provide the literacy rates for males and females separately, we cannot write an SQL query to extract this information. However, we can write a hypothetical SQL query to illustrate what we would do if the data were available in the table.\n\n```sql\nSELECT `Literacy in CD Blocks of South 24 Parganas district`, `Thakurpukur Maheshtala` FROM Literacy_Census WHERE `Alipore Sadar subdivision` = 'Thakurpukur Maheshtala'\n```\nExpected result:\n```\nLiteracy in CD Blocks of South 24 Parganas district | Thakurpukur Maheshtala\n83.54% | 83.54%\n```\n\n3. Step-by-step answer prediction\n- The claim states that the highest percentage of literacy in CD Blocks of South 24 Parganas district, Alipore Sadar subdivision, is in Thakurpukur Maheshtala with 83.54% of only its male population.\n- The sentence context provides the literacy rates for males and females in Thakurpukur Maheshtala: males numbered 70,300 (87.95% of the male population over 6 years) and females numbered 61,797 (79.03% of the female population over 6 years).\n- The claim incorrectly states that the literacy rate of 83.54% is for the male population only, while the table context clearly indicates that this is the total literacy rate for the entire population. The sentence context confirms that the male literacy rate is 87.95%, which is indeed higher than the female literacy rate of 79.03%, but it is not the total literacy rate as claimed.\n- Therefore, the claim is refuted by the sentence context, which provides the separate literacy rates for males and females.\n\nThe answer is REFUTES.",

Mike Adams was drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the second round with pick number 56, not by the Houston Texans in round six with pick number 27.\n- Additionally, the sentence context Mike Adams (safety) indicates that he was undrafted in the 2004 NFL Draft, which contradicts the claim that he was drafted in 2012.\n- The sentence context also indicates that Mike Adams (safety) was signed by the Houston Texans on September 30, 2019, which does not support the claim that he was drafted by them in 2012.\n\nTherefore, the answer is REFUTES.",

USD$ | Net income in mil. USD$\n2005 | 81,663 | 8,528\n```\n\n3. Step-by-step answer prediction\n- The claim states that Berkshire Hathaway was ranked second on the Fortune 500 in 2005 and had a net income of 8,528 in million USD and a revenue of 81,663 in million USD.\n- The SQL query result supports the claim regarding the net income and revenue for the year 2005.\n- However, the sentence context refutes the claim about the rank, as it states that as of 2018, Berkshire Hathaway is ranked third on the Fortune 500, not second.\n- Therefore, the claim is partially supported and partially refuted. Since the claim must be entirely correct to be supported and the rank part is incorrect, the final answer is REFUTES.",

Step-by-step answer prediction\n- The claim states that the population of Baykal is 3,303, but the table shows the population of Baykal is 562. This refutes the claim regarding Baykal's population.\n- The claim states that the population of Bivolare is 627, which is supported by the table.\n- The claim states that the population of Bozhuritsa is 1,102, which is supported by the table.\n- The claim states that the population of Bregare is 637, which is supported by the table.\n- The sentence context Bregare: The Father Paisius school's current building was opened in 1934 supports the claim that The Father Paisius school in Bregare was opened in 1934.\n\nTherefore, the answer is REFUTES because the population of Baykal in the claim does not match the population provided in the table.",
