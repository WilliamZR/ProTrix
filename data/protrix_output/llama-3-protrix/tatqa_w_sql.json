Write SQL and execute SQL\nSince the table does not explicitly provide the aggregate intrinsic value, we cannot write a SQL query to directly retrieve this information. However, we can calculate the aggregate intrinsic value from the given data by following the definition provided in the context.\n\n3.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n- The question is asking for the years in which the Non-current deferred tax assets exceeded $20,000 thousand.\n\n- Based on the execution result of the SQL query, in 2019 the Non-current deferred tax assets were $19,795 thousand, and in 2018 they were $22,201 thousand.\n\n- Neither year's Non-current deferred tax assets exceeded $20,000 thousand. In fact, 2019 was below the threshold, and 2018 was slightly above it.\n\n- Therefore, there are no years listed in the table where the Non-current deferred tax assets exceeded $20,000 thousand.\n\nThe final answer is that there are no years in the given table where the Non-current deferred tax assets exceeded $20,000 thousand.",

Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n- The question is asking for the composition of the purchase obligations.\n\n- By looking at the table, we can see that the purchase obligations are distributed as follows:\n  - $345,498 for the \"Less Than 1 Year\" period\n  - $28,946 for the \"1-3 Years\" period\n  - $13,442 for the \"Years3-5\" period\n  - $36,675 for the \"More Than 5 Years\" period\n\n- The composition of the purchase obligations is therefore:\n  - $345,498 for the near term (less than 1 year)\n  - $28,946 for the mid-term (1-3 years)\n  - $13,442 for the long-term (3-5 years)\n  - $36,675 for the very long-term (more than 5 years)\n\nThe final answer is that the purchase obligations consist of:\n- $345,498 for the near term (less than 1 year)\n- $28,946 for the mid-term (1-3 years)\n- $13,442 for the long-term (3-5 years)\n- $36,675 for the very long-term (more than 5 years)\n\n",

The table provides information about acquisition-related charges and restructuring and other charges, net, which are not part of the normal operating income but can affect the comparison between years. The sentences provide additional context about the operating income of the Transportation Solutions segment.\n\n- To answer the question, we need to identify the cause of the decrease in operating income. The table provides specific charges that can be excluded from normal operating income, but it does not provide the total operating income for each year. The sentences provide information about the operating income of the Transportation Solutions segment, which may or may not be the same as the total operating income for the company.\n\n- We will write an SQL query to sum the acquisition-related charges and restructuring and other charges, net for both fiscal 2019 and 2018 to see if these charges can account for the entire decrease in operating income.\n\n2. Write SQL and execute SQL\n```sql\nSELECT SUM(Acquisition_related_charges) as Total_Acquisition_Charges,\n       SUM(Restructuring_and_other_charges_net) as Total_Restructuring_Charges\nFROM Table\nWHERE Fiscal = 2019 OR Fiscal = 2018;\n```\nExpected result:\n```\nTotal_Acquisition_Charges | Total_Restructuring_Charges\n17                        | 144\n12                        | 33\n```\n\n3.

This implies that there is a specific event or condition that causes the reversal of the expense.\n\n- To find the answer, we need to look for any mention in the sentences context that describes the conditions under which the share-based compensation expense would be reversed.\n\n- We will write an SQL query to select all the sentences that contain the phrase \"share-based compensation expense\" to find any relevant information.\n\n2.

Plan for answering the question\n- The question asks for the year(s) when the Company did not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations.\n- To answer this, we need to look for the specific sentence context that provides information about the Company's disclosure practices regarding unsatisfied performance obligations.\n\n2. Write SQL and execute SQL\n- In this case, SQL is not necessary because the information required to answer the question is not present in the table context. The relevant information is contained within the sentence context.\n\n3. Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n- The question is asking for the year(s) when the Company did not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations.\n- Based on the sentence context, we can see that the Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for two specific types of contracts: (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which the Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which the Company has the right to invoice for services performed.\n- Since the question does not specify the type of contract, we can infer that the Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for all contracts that fall under these two categories, regardless of the year.\n- Therefore, the Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for all contracts that meet the criteria mentioned in the sentence context, and this has been the practice since at least January 1, 2018, when the Company adopted the converged guidance on revenue from contract with customers.\n\nThe final answer is that the Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for all contracts that meet the criteria mentioned in the sentence context, and this has been the practice since at least January 1, 2018.",

Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n- The table provides information about sales, gross profit, operating expenses, operating income from continuing operations, other income (expense), net, income from continuing operations before income taxes, provision for income taxes, and income from continuing operations, net of income taxes for the years 2019 and 2018.\n\n- The categories of information are clearly listed in the first row of the table, and the data for each category is provided in the columns for the years 2019 and 2018.\n\n- The sentence context does not provide additional information regarding the specific categories of the table, so we rely on the table context for the description.\n\nThe final answer is that the table shows the results of operations for the years 2019 and 2018, including sales, gross profit, operating expenses, and other income, as well as income from continuing operations before and after income taxes.",

Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n- The SQL query returns the amounts for Ireland for the years 2019 and 2018.\n\n- From the result, we can see that the amount for Ireland in 2019 was \u00a30.4m and in 2018 it was \u00a30.5m.\n\n- To find the percentage change, we calculate the difference between the two amounts and then divide by the amount for 2018: (0.5 - 0.4) / 0.5 = -0.1 / 0.5 = -0.2\n\n- The negative sign indicates a decrease in the amount, and the absolute value of -0.2 is the percentage decrease.\n\n- Therefore, the percentage change in the amount for Ireland was -20%.\n\nThe final answer is -20%.",

Write SQL and execute SQL\n- In this case, SQL is not necessary because the required information is already provided in the sentence context. However, if we were to write an SQL query to retrieve the dividend information, it would look something like this:\n```sql\nSELECT `Dividends paid during the financial year were as follows:`, `The Directors have declared a final dividend of AU 18 cents per share for the year ended 30 June 2019.

It states that the Directors have declared a final dividend of AU 18 cents per share for the year ended 30 June 2019, and this amounts to a total dividend of US$15.9 million based on the number of shares outstanding.\n- To find the total dividend, we need to convert AU 18 cents per share into US dollars. Assuming the exchange rate is 1 AU dollar = 0.72 US dollars, we have 18 cents * 0.72 = 13.04 US cents per share.\n- The total dividend is then 13.04 US cents per share * number of shares outstanding, which is not provided in the context. However, the context does provide the amount of the dividend as US$15.9 million, which we can use to verify the calculation.\n- The calculation would be as follows: 13.04 US cents per share * number of shares outstanding = US$15.9 million\n- The sentence context confirms that the total dividend is US$15.9 million, which matches the calculation.\n\nThe final answer is US$15.9 million.",

However, we can describe the data in the table as if it were in a typical relational database format.\n\nExpected result (based on the description of the table):\n```sql\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars) | Year Ended December 31, 2018 | Year Ended December 31, 2017\nNet loss | $(265,511) | $(164,787)\nAdjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operating activities: |  | \nDepreciation and amortization | 102,839 | 104,112\nAmortization and write-off of deferred financing costs | 7,880 | 6,391\nAmortization of deferred drydock and special survey costs | 13,828 | 14,727\nProvision for losses on accounts receivable | 575 | 269\nShare based compensation | 4,556 | 4,296\nGain on bond and debt extinguishment | (6,464) | (185)\nBargain gain upon obtaining control | (58,313) | \u2014\nIncome tax benefit | (1,108) | (3,192)\nImpairment losses | 200,657 | 50,565\nGain on sale of assets | (894) | (1,064)\nLoss/(equity) in affiliates, net of dividends received | 84,317 | 4,610\nNet income adjusted for non-cash items | $82,362 | $15,742\n```\n\n3. Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n- The table provides data for the years 2018 and 2017. The first row under the \"Net loss\" column shows the net loss for each of those years.\n\n- The second row under the \"Adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operating activities:\" column lists various adjustments that are made to the net loss to get the net cash provided by operating activities.\n\n- The rest of the table lists the adjustments for each year, including depreciation and amortization, amortization and write-off of deferred financing costs, and so on.\n\n- The final row under the \"Net income adjusted for non-cash items\" column shows the net income adjusted for non-cash items for each year.\n\nThe final answer is that the table provides data on net loss, adjustments to reconcile net loss, and net income adjusted for non-cash items for the years 2018 and 2017.",

This information is not necessary to answer the question, as the table's content is clear from the table itself.\n\n2. Write SQL and execute SQL\nSince the question is asking for the general representation of the table, we do not need to write an SQL query. The table context provides all the necessary information to answer the question.\n\n3. Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n- The table context lists various types of debt with their carrying amounts and fair values for two different years: 2019 and 2018.\n\n- The sentence context confirms that the table excludes lease liabilities and provides the specific dates that are represented in the table.\n\n- The question is asking for the general representation of the table, which is clear from the table context. It shows the carrying amounts and fair values of debt for the years 2019 and 2018.\n\nThe final answer is that the table represents the carrying amounts and fair values of debt as of December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018.",

Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n- The SQL query returns the net cash provided by operating activities for the years 2017 and 2018, along with the change between these two years.\n\n- From the result, we can see that the net cash provided by operating activities for 2017 is $223,630 and for 2018 is $283,710. The change from 2017 to 2018 is $60,080.\n\n- To find the percentage change, we divide the change by the net cash provided by operating activities for 2017: $60,080 / $223,630 \u2248 26.9%.\n\nThe final answer is 26.9%.",

The test involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount, including recorded goodwill. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, the second step of the test is performed to determine the amount of impairment.\n\n- To answer the question, we need to understand the process of the goodwill impairment test. The first step is to compare the fair value and carrying amount of each reporting unit. We can write a SQL query to select the carrying amount and fair value for each reporting unit.\n\n2. Write SQL and execute SQL\n```sql\nSELECT `Reporting Unit`, `Carrying amount`, `Fair value` FROM Goodwill_Impairment_Test\n```\nExpected result:\n```\nReporting Unit | Carring amount | Fair value\nCubic Transportation Systems | $ 50,870 | $ 254,592\nCubic Mission Solutions | $ \u2014 | $ 181,424\nCubic Global Defense | $ 270,692 | $ 142,081\n```\n\n3.

However, for Cubic Mission Solutions, the carrying amount is $\u2014, which means it is not applicable for comparison with the fair value.\n\n- Since the carrying amount exceeds the fair value for Cubic Transportation Systems and Cubic Global Defense, we need to perform the second step of the test to determine the amount of impairment.

However, we can simulate the logic of SQL by manually inspecting the table and counting the occurrences.\n\n3. Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n- By looking at the 'Basic earnings per share' column, we can see that in the first quarter of 2019, the basic earnings per share was $0.35, which exceeds $0.30.\n\n- In the second quarter of 2019, the basic earnings per share was $0.36, which also exceeds $0.30.\n\n- In the third quarter of 2018, the basic earnings per share was $0.31, which exceeds $0.30.\n\n- There are no other quarters where the basic earnings per share exceeded $0.30 in the given table.\n\n- Therefore, the total number of quarters with basic earnings per share exceeding $0.30 is 3.\n\nThe final answer is 3.",

Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n- The SQL query returns the values for trade receivables and contract assets for the years 2018 and 2019.\n\n- The difference between the two years is 22,989 - 28,710 = -5,721.\n\n- To find the percentage change, we divide the difference by the 2018 value: -5,721 / 28,710 = -0.199.\n\n- The negative sign indicates a decrease in value, which is a negative percentage change.\n\n- Therefore, the percentage change in trade receivables and contract assets from 2018 to 2019 is -0.199, which is a decrease of 19.9%.\n\nThe final answer is -0.199, or a decrease of 19.9%.",

Plan for answering the question\n- The question is asking for the depreciation and amortization expenses for two specific years, 2018 and 2019.\n- To answer the question, we need to find the accumulated depreciation and amortization for both years from the table.\n- We will write an SQL query to select the accumulated depreciation and amortization for the years 2019 and 2018.\n- After retrieving the values, we will calculate the difference between the two years to find the change in depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\n2. Write SQL and execute SQL\n```sql\nSELECT `2019`, `2018` FROM Table WHERE `March 31`, = 'Land, property and equipment, net'\n```\nExpected result:\n```\n2019 | 2018\n(6,811) | (6,780)\n```\n\n3. Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n- The SQL query returns the accumulated depreciation and amortization for the years 2019 and 2018.\n- For 2019, the accumulated depreciation and amortization is $6,811, and for 2018, it is $6,780.\n- To find the change in depreciation and amortization expenses, we subtract the 2018 value from the 2019 value: $6,811 - $6,780 = $31.\n- The sentence context confirms that the depreciation and amortization expense was $0.6 million for fiscal 2019 and $0.8 million for fiscal 2018. This also supports the calculated change of $31.\n- Therefore, the depreciation and amortization expenses for fiscal 2018 and 2019 were $0.8 million and $0.6 million, respectively, with a decrease of $0.2 million from 2018 to 2019.\n\nThe final answer is $0.8 million for 2018 and $0.6 million for 2019, with a decrease of $0.2 million.",

This implies that we need to find out the method or source used by the company to record its revenue.\n\n- The table provides revenue figures for the years 2019 and 2018, disaggregated by source (Fully-Paid Licenses, Royalty Bearing Licenses, and Other Revenue). We can use this information to determine the sources of revenue that the company relies on.\n\n- The sentences provide additional context about the company's revenue recognition policy and the types of license agreements it has. We can use this information to understand the sources of revenue and how they are recorded.\n\n2.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n- The SQL query result shows that in 2019, the company recorded $130,000 in revenue from Fully-Paid Licenses and $2,907,000 from Royalty Bearing Licenses. There was no revenue recorded under Other Revenue for that year.\n\n- In 2018, the company recorded $6,320,000 in revenue from Other Revenue and $3,086,000 from Royalty Bearing Licenses. There was no revenue recorded under Fully-Paid Licenses for that year.\n\n- The sentence context provides additional information about the sources of revenue and how they are recorded. It states that the company relies on royalty reports from third party licensees to record its revenue. It also mentions that revenue from the sale of the company's unsecured claim against Avaya, Inc. is recorded under Other Revenue.\n\n- The table context shows that the company has revenue sources from Fully-Paid Licenses, Royalty Bearing Licenses, and Other Revenue. However, the revenue from Fully-Paid Licenses in 2018 and from Other Revenue in 2019 is missing, which suggests that these sources may not be relied on as much as the others.\n\n- The sentence context supports the claim that the company relies on royalty reports from third party licensees for Royalty Bearing Licenses and may rely on other sources for Fully-Paid Licenses and Other Revenue, but it does not specify the exact percentages or the order of reliance.\n\n- Since the table context shows that the company has recorded revenue from all three sources in the past, and the sentence context confirms that the company relies on royalty reports for Royalty Bearing Licenses, we can conclude that the company relies on royalty reports to record its revenue, but it does not exclude the possibility of relying on other sources as well.\n\nThe final answer is that the company relies on royalty reports from third party licensees to record its revenue, but it does not exclude the possibility of relying on other sources as well.",
