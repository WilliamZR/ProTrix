Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n- From the SQL query result, we can see that the WOM for TGen-trained systems is 15.94 for the original data and 15.77 for the cleaned data.\n- The WOM for TGen+-trained systems is 00.06 for the original data and 00.03 for the cleaned data.\n- The WOM for SC-LSTM-trained systems is 09.79 for the original data and 08.12 for the cleaned data.\n- The claim states that WOMs are slightly lower for TGen-trained on the cleaned data, except for NIST, which gives more importance to matching less frequent n-grams.\n- The WOM for TGen-trained systems is indeed slightly lower for the cleaned data (15.77) compared to the original data (15.94), which supports the claim.\n- However, the claim also states that NIST gives more importance to matching less frequent n-grams. This part of the claim is not directly supported by the table since the WOM values are not comparable across systems.\n- The table does not provide information about the importance given to less frequent n-grams, and we cannot determine from the table whether NIST is indeed giving more importance to less frequent n-grams.\n\nTherefore, the answer is NOT ENOUGH INFO, as the table does not provide the necessary information to fully support or refute the claim about the importance given to less frequent n-grams by NIST.",

        "generated_text": "1. Plan for answering the question\n- The claim states that GINs can be employed in tasks where the distribution of node degrees has a long tail. To verify this claim, we need to check the table for any information regarding the degree distribution of the nodes.\n- We will look for any mention of the graph diameter, sentence length, or max node out-degree in the table. The graph diameter and sentence length are related to the distribution of node degrees, as they can affect the number of nodes and the complexity of the graph. The max node out-degree is directly related to the degree distribution since it represents the maximum number of outgoing edges a node can have.\n- We will write SQL queries to extract the differences in the graph diameter, sentence length, and max node out-degree for the GIN model compared to the S2S model.\n\n2. Write SQL and execute SQL\n```sql\nSELECT `Graph Diameter` FROM Table WHERE `Model` = 'G2S-GIN'\n```\nExpected result:\n```\nGraph Diameter\n36.7 +5.2%\n32.2 +7.8%\n26.5 +5.8%\n```\n\n```sql\nSELECT `Sentence Length` FROM Table WHERE `Model` = 'G2S-GIN'\n```\nExpected result:\n```\nSentence Length\n0-20 \u0394\n20-50 \u0394\n50-240 \u0394\n```\n\n```sql\nSELECT `Max Node Out-degree` FROM Table WHERE `Model` = 'G2S-GIN'\n```\nExpected result:\n```\nMax Node Out-degree\n0-3 \u0394\n4-8 \u0394\n9-18 \u0394\n```\n\n3. Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n- The table shows that the GIN model has a larger graph diameter for the 14-20 range compared to the S2S model (31.5 vs. 28.8 for G2S-GIN and 31.5 vs. 28.8 for G2S-GGNN). This indicates that the GIN model can handle a larger graph diameter, which is consistent with a long-tailed degree distribution.\n- The table also shows that the GIN model has a larger sentence length for the 14-20 range compared to the S2S model (31.5 vs. 28.8 for G2S-GIN and 31.5 vs. 28.8 for G2S-GGNN). This indicates that the GIN model can handle more complex sentences, which is consistent with a long-tailed degree distribution.\n- The table shows that the GIN model has a larger max node out-degree for the 9-18 range compared to the S2S model (26.5 vs. 23.9 for G2S-GIN and 26.9 vs. 23.9 for G2S-GGNN). This indicates that the GIN model can handle a higher maximum out-degree, which is consistent with a long-tailed degree distribution.\n\nTherefore, the claim that GINs can be employed in tasks where the distribution of node degrees has a long tail is supported by the table context.",

Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n- The SQL query returns the top 10 features that are significantly correlated with the non-complaint tweets.\n\n- Among these features, we can see that \"!\" and \"thank\" are used to express positive emotions such as surprise and gratitude, respectively.\n\n- The terms \"lol,\" \"you,\" \"great,\" \"win,\" and \"\u2019\" are also commonly used to express positive emotions or humor in text.\n\n- The terms \"it\" and \"that\" are not typically associated with positive emotions but are included in the list as they are also commonly used in text and may not be specific to complaints.\n\n- Based on the table, the presence of terms that show positive sentiment or emotions is indeed among the top most distinctive features for a tweet not being labeled as a complaint.\n\nThe final answer is SUPPORT.",

Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n- The claim is that there is a significant drop in ARI score from OD to OD (no polarity shifters) because the only change is in the sentiment polarity shifters.\n- According to the SQL query result, we can see that the ARI scores for OD (no polarity shifters) are lower than those for OD across all difference functions.\n- This indicates that the claim is incorrect because the drop in ARI score is not due to the removal of sentiment polarity shifters but rather due to the use of different distance functions in OD (no polarity shifters).\n- Therefore, the answer is REFUTE.",

Write SQL and execute SQL\n```sql\nSELECT `WN-N P`, `WN-N R`, `WN-N F`, `WN-V P`, `WN-V R`, `WN-V F`, `VN P`, `VN R`, `VN F`\nFROM Table\nWHERE `Paper title` = 'From Text to Lexicon: Bridging the Gap between Word Embeddings and Lexical Resources'\n```\nExpected result:\n```\n| WN-N P | WN-N R | WN-N F | WN-V P | WN-V R | WN-V F | VN P | VN R | VN F |\n| .710  | .662  | .685  | .589  | .529  | .557  | .410  | .389  | .399  |\n```\n\n3. Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n- The claim states that lemma-based targets without POS disambiguation perform best on WN-N when dependency-based contexts are used. The table shows that the lemma-based targets without POS disambiguation (x+POS) have the highest performance on WN-N (.710, .662, .685), which supports this part of the claim.\n- The claim also states that the difference to lemmatized and disambiguated targets is not statistically significant (p > .1). To verify this, we need to compare the performance of the lemma-based targets without POS disambiguation to the lemmatized and disambiguated targets.\n- The table shows that the performance of the lemma-based targets without POS disambiguation (.710, .662, .685) is higher than the performance of the lemmatized targets (.706, .660, .682) and the disambiguated targets (.706, .660, .682).\n- However, the difference in performance between the lemma-based targets without POS disambiguation and the lemmatized targets is only .004 on WN-N (.710 - .706 = .004), and the difference to the disambiguated targets is even smaller (.710 - .706 = .004).\n- Since the differences are so small (.004), it is not clear if they are statistically significant at the p > .1 level.\n\nTherefore, the answer is NOT ENOUGH INFO, because we need to calculate the p-value to determine if the differences are statistically significant.",

Write SQL and execute SQL\n```sql\nSELECT `Model`, `Acc`, `F1`, `AUC` FROM Table WHERE `Model` IN ('POS Bigrams', 'LIWC', 'Word2Vec Clusters')\n```\nExpected result:\n```\nModel                  | Acc  | F1  | AUC\nPOS Bigrams             | 72.2 | 66.8 | 0.756\nLIWC                   | 71.6 | 65.8 | 0.784\nWord2Vec Clusters       | 67.7 | 58.3 | 0.738\n```\n\n3. Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n- The claim is that the topical features perform in the same range as part of speech tags.\n- From the SQL query result, we can see that the performance of the part of speech tags (POS Bigrams) is 72.2% accuracy, 66.8% F1 score, and 0.756 AUC.\n- The performance of the topical features (LIWC and Word2Vec Clusters) is 71.6% accuracy, 65.8% F1 score, and 0.784 AUC for LIWC and 67.7% accuracy, 58.3% F1 score, and 0.738 AUC for Word2Vec Clusters.\n- The performance of the topical features is not in the same range as the part of speech tags. The accuracy and F1 scores for the topical features are lower, and the AUC for LIWC is higher but not by a significant margin.\n- Therefore, the claim that the topical features perform in the same range as part of speech tags is refuted by the table context.\n\nThe final answer is REFUTED.",

Plan for answering the question\n- The question asks whether the claim that we see a varying increase in sentiment value across all three models after finetuning is supported or refuted by the provided table.\n- To answer this, we need to compare the sentiment score changes for each model (RNN, CNN, DAN) before and after finetuning.\n- We will write an SQL query to select the sentiment score changes for each model before and after finetuning.\n\n2. Write SQL and execute SQL\n```sql\nSELECT `RNN`, `CNN`, `DAN` FROM Sentiment_Score_Changes WHERE `RNN` = 'Positive' OR `RNN` = 'Negative' OR `RNN` = 'Flipped to Positive' OR `RNN` = 'Flipped to Negative'\n```\nExpected result:\n```\n| RNN | CNN | DAN |\n| Positive | +9.7 | +4.3 | +23.6\n| Negative | +6.9 | +5.5 | +16.1\n| Flipped to Positive | +20.2 | +24.9 | +27.4\n| Flipped to Negative | +31.5 | +28.6 | +19.3\n```\n\n3. Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n- The claim states that we see a varying increase in sentiment value across all three models after finetuning.\n- The SQL query result shows that the sentiment score increases for all models after finetuning, with the largest increase for the DAN model for both positive and negative sentiment.\n- The table also shows that the score increases in both positive and negative sentiment for the RNN and CNN models when flipped labels are considered.\n- The claim is supported by the table, as it shows a varying increase in sentiment value across all three models after finetuning, indicating that the framework is able to pick up on words that are indicative of sentiment.\n\nTherefore, the answer is SUPPORT.",

Write SQL and execute SQL\n```sql\nSELECT `Model`, `BLEU`, `METEOR` FROM Table WHERE `Model` = 'S2S'\n```\nExpected result:\n```\nModel       | BLEU  | METEOR\nS2S         | 25.70 | 30.53\n```\n\n```sql\nSELECT `Model`, `BLEU`, `METEOR` FROM Table WHERE `Model` = 'G2S-GGNN'\n```\nExpected result:\n```\nModel       | BLEU  | METEOR\nG2S-GGNN    | 27.87 | 33.21\n```\n\n3. Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n- The question is asking for a comparison of BLEU and METEOR scores between our model and Damonte et al. (2019) on the same datasets.\n\n- Based on the execution result of the SQL query, we can see that the BLEU score for S2S is 25.70 and the METEOR score is 30.53.\n\n- For G2S-GGNN, the BLEU score is 27.87 and the METEOR score is 33.21.\n\n- Comparing these scores with the scores of Damonte et al. (2019), we can see that their BLEU score for LDC2015E86 is 24.40 and their METEOR score is 23.60.\n\n- For LDC2017T10, their BLEU score is 24.54 and their METEOR score is 24.07.\n\n- Since our scores are higher than Damonte et al. (2019) for both datasets, the claim that our results are not as competitive as Damonte and Cohen (2019) is refuted.\n\nThe final answer is REFUTED.",

Write SQL and execute SQL \n```sql\nSELECT Model, Success, BLEU, Combined_Score FROM Table WHERE System_Action_Type = 'generated' AND System_Action_Form = 'span'\n```\nExpected result:\n```\n| Model                                  | Success | BLEU  | Combined_Score |\n| DAMD                                   | 75.8    | 18.3  | 100.9           |\n| DAMD + multi-action data augmentation  | 77.9    | 18.6  | 102.2           |\n| SFN + RL (Mehri et al. mehri2019structured) | 72.1    | 16.3  | 93.7           |\n| HDSA                                   | 78.0    | 30.4  | 113.4           |\n```\n\n3. Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n- The question is asking for a comparison of performance between DAMD + multi-action data augmentation and all other models where the system action is modeled.\n\n- Based on the execution result of the SQL query, we can see that DAMD + multi-action data augmentation has a higher success rate (77.9%) and a higher BLEU score (18.6) compared to the other models listed.\n\n- The combined score of 102.2 for DAMD + multi-action data augmentation is also higher than the other models listed.\n\n- Since none of the other models have a higher success rate, BLEU score, or combined score than DAMD + multi-action data augmentation, the claim that it performs much better than all the other models is supported by the table context.\n\nThe final answer is SUPPORTED.",

For the LSTM-400, the difference is 67.59 - 68.00 = -0.41, which is also a large discrepancy.\n\n- Therefore, the claim that small differences in the CV score are associated with large discrepancies in test set performance is not supported by the data.

Write SQL and execute SQL\nFor the symmetric mode:\n```sql\nSELECT `Image to Text R@1`, `Image to Text R@5`, `Image to Text R@10`, `Text to Image R@1`, `Text to Image R@5`, `Text to Image R@10`, `Text to Image Mr`, `Alignment` FROM Table WHERE `Table caption` = 'Table 4: Image-caption ranking results for Japanese (MS-COCO)' AND `Table caption` = '[BOLD] symmetric'\n```\nExpected result:\n```\n| Image to Text R@1 | Image to Text R@5 | Image to Text R@10 | Text to Image R@1 | Text to Image R@5 | Text to Image R@10 | Text to Image Mr | Alignment |\n| 50.2              | 85.6              | 93.1              | 40.2              | 76.7              | 87.8              | 2            | 82.54%      |\n```\n\nFor the asymmetric mode:\n```sql\nSELECT `Image to Text R@1`, `Image to Text R@5`, `Image to Text R@10`, `Text to Image R@1`, `Text to Image R@5`, `Text to Image R@10`, `Text to Image Mr`, `Alignment` FROM Table WHERE `Table caption` = 'Table 4: Image-caption ranking results for Japanese (MS-COCO)' AND `Table caption` = '[BOLD] asymmetric'\n```\nExpected result:\n```\n| Image to Text R@1 | Image to Text R@5 | Image to Text R@10 | Text to Image R@1 | Text to Image R@5 | Text to Image R@10 | Text to Image Mr | Alignment |\n| 55.5              | 87.9              | 95.2              | 44.9              | 80.7              | 89.3              | 2            | 84.99%      |\n```\n\n3. Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n- The SQL query results show that in the symmetric mode, the AME model does not reach better results on average compared to the monolingual model. The AME model has an image-to-text R@1 of 50.2, while the monolingual model has 49.9.\n\n- The SQL query results also show that in the asymmetric mode, the AME model does reach better results on average compared to the monolingual model. The AME model has an image-to-text R@1 of 55.5, while the monolingual model has 49.9.\n\n- Since the claim is about the average results across both modes, and the AME model does not reach better results in the symmetric mode but does in the asymmetric mode, the claim is refuted.\n\nTherefore, the answer is REFUTED.",

Write SQL and execute SQL\n```sql\nSELECT `Graph Diameter`0-7 \u0394, `Graph Diameter`7-13 \u0394, `Graph Diameter`14-20 \u0394 FROM Table WHERE `Model` = 'S2S'\n```\nExpected result:\n```\n| Graph Diameter | 0-7 \u0394 | 7-13 \u0394 | 14-20 \u0394 |\n| S2S            | 34.9  | 29.9  | 25.1   |\n```\n\n3. Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n- The SQL query result shows the METEOR scores for the S2S model at different graph diameters.\n- The scores for the S2S model at the smaller diameter (0-7) are 34.9, and the scores for the larger diameter (14-20) are 25.1.\n- The claim states that the models have fewer examples of bigger graphs to learn from, which leads to worse performance when handling graphs with higher diameters.\n- The METEOR score for the S2S model at the diameter of 14-20 is 25.1, which indicates that the model performed worse compared to the other diameters.\n- The table context supports the claim that the S2S model has worse performance on graphs with higher diameters.\n\nTherefore, the answer is SUPPORT.",
